hen in the ourse of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the aws of ature and of atures od entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation e hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their reator with certain unalienable ights that among these are ife iberty and the pursuit of appinesshat to secure these rights overnments are instituted among en deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed hat whenever any orm of overnment becomes destructive of these ends it is the ight of the eople to alter or to abolish it and to institute new overnment laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their afety and appiness rudence indeed will dictate that overnments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed ut when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same bject evinces a design to reduce them under absolute espotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such overnment and to provide new uards for their future securityuch has been the patient sufferance of these olonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former ystems of overnment he history of the present ing of reat ritain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute yranny over these tates o prove this let acts be submitted to a candid world  e has refused his ssent to aws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good  e has forbidden his overnors to pass aws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his ssent should be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them  e has refused to pass other aws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of epresentation in the egislature a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only  e has called together legislative bodies at places unusual uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public ecords for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures  e has dissolved epresentative ouses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people  e has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected whereby the egislative powers incapable of nnihilation have returned to the eople at large for their exercise the tate remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within  e has endeavoured to prevent the population of these tates for that purpose obstructing the aws for aturalization of oreigners refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither and raising the conditions of new ppropriations of ands  e has obstructed the dministration of ustice by refusing his ssent to aws for establishing udiciary powers  e has made udges dependent on his ill alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries  e has erected a multitude of ew ffices and sent hither swarms of fficers to harrass our people and eat out their substance  e has kept among us in times of peace tanding rmies without the onsent of our legislatures  e has affected to render the ilitary independent of and superior to the ivil power  e has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving his ssent to their cts of pretended egislation  or uartering large bodies of armed troops among us or protecting them by a mock rial from punishment for any urders which they should commit on the nhabitants of these tates  or cutting off our rade with all parts of the world  or imposing axes on us without our onsent  or depriving us in many cases of the benefits of rial by ury  or transporting us beyond eas to be tried for pretended offences  or abolishing the free ystem of nglish aws in a neighbouring rovince establishing therein an rbitrary government and enlarging its oundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these olonies  or taking away our harters abolishing our most valuable aws and altering fundamentally the orms of our overnments  or suspending our own egislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever  e has abdicated overnment here by declaring us out of his rotection and waging ar against us  e has plundered our seas ravaged our oasts burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people  e is at this time transporting large rmies of foreign ercenaries to compleat the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of ruelty  perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages and totally unworthy the ead of a civilized nation  e has constrained our fellow itizens taken aptive on the high eas to bear rms against their ountry to become the executioners of their friends and rethren or to fall themselves by their ands  e has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless ndian avages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and conditions  n every stage of these ppressions e have etitioned for edress in the most humble terms ur repeated etitions have been answered only by repeated injury  rince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a yrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people  or have e been wanting in attentions to our rittish brethren e have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us e have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here e have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence hey too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity e must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our eparation and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind nemies in ar in eace riends  e therefore the epresentatives of the united tates of merica in eneral ongress ssembled appealing to the upreme udge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions do in the ame and by uthority of the good eople of these olonies solemnly publish and declare hat these nited olonies are and of ight ought to be ree and ndependent tates that they are bsolved from all llegiance to the ritish rown and that all political connection between them and the tate of reat ritain is and ought to be totally dissolved and that as ree and ndependent tates they have full ower to levy ar conclude eace contract lliances establish ommerce and to do all other cts and hings which ndependent tates may of right do nd for the support of this eclaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine rovidence we mutually pledge to each other our ives our ortunes and our sacred onor
